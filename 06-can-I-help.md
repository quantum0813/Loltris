Sure you can!

If you have programming experience and would like to work on Loltris,
all you have to do is fork [The repo](https://github.com/UndeadMastodon/Loltris)
on GitHub, you can send me (UndeadMastodon) a pull request later on if you'd
like your work to be included into Loltris. If you **really** dont like using git,
it's also ok if you send patches to my email account (which you can find on the contact
page.)

I also appreciate bug-reports sent to me. If you would like to send me a bug-report,
please follow [these guidelines](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/QA/Bug_writing_guidelines).
