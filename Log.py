## XXX: Some functions still specify the function argument in log functions,
##      this is no longer needed and not recommended. No effort is being made
##      to replace all the occurenses of Log.xxx(function="yyy"), but this
##      could be accomplished with a not too complicated regex.

## TODO: I should define all these functions to take the arguments (comment, **kwargs)
##       the problem is that i would have to review all Log calls.

## All the log and error functions will pass all exceptions quietly, the last thing
## we want is the error message function crashing the server...
