This site is dedicated to Loltris, a Tetris-clone written in Python/Pygame by
a person with WAY too much time on his hands.

It is called Loltris because of it's "non-standard" features such as its
"Ãœberblock" and the ability to "flip" blocks the other way around. If you
want to know more about the things Loltris can do (will let you do) then
you should visit the "About" page.

If you just want to get the game, head over to the "Download" page where you
can find a stable (somewhat stable) binary release for your platform.
