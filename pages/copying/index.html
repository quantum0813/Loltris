                    Can I steal it?
                </h1>
                <p>Without raising any philosophical questions regarding whether one
can truly steal anything from the internet. Yes and no.</p>

<p>Loltris is licensed under the GNU general public license, which means
that you can do <i>almost</i> anything. You may copy it, modify the source
(the source that you have a <strong>right</strong> to, according to the license) and
even redistribute your modified version. The only condition is that you
apply the same license (i.e the GNU general public license) to this new
shiny version of Loltris (or whatever other name you may choose to give
it.) Technically, under this license you could sell Loltris for profit.
Although it would be like trying to sell expensive medical insurance to Scandinavians,
since you can already get it free from this site, and according to the license
anyone can share your new version as they please. If you plan on releasing a
modified version of Loltris, I advice you to read
<a href="https://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">the full license</a>.</p>

<p>So to summarize, you can create your own tetris-clone, with hookers
and blackjack. But if you use my code, you have to publish the new version
(with hookers, blackjack and whatnot) under the GNU general public
license.</p>
